                    <p>Restore is a third-generation product in the UltraMito line of mitochondria-related products. It was created by scientist and formulator, Dr. Bevan Elliott. Informed by his background in nanotechnology, physics and emerging science, he created a new, proprietary technology designed to potentiate the mitochondria.

                      <h2>About Restore</h2>
                      <p>URestore is an adaptogenic formulation designed to promote:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Stimulant-free, natural energy from the mitochondria that can outlast your longest day</li>
                      <li>Enhanced brain ability, with the vision, clarity, and focus to meet your every challenge</li>
                      <li> Mood enhancement and chronic stress reduction</li>
                      <li>Deeper, more restorative sleep</li>
                      <li>Cellular detoxification and repair</li>
                      <li>Immune system enhancement with anti-parasitic and anti-pathogenic support</li>
                      <li>Body-wide support for major organ systems</li>
                      <li>Enhanced ability for the body to manage itself and maintain homeostasis</li>
                      <br>
                      <p>To accomplish these objectives, natural ingredients are preferred because they tend to be multi-functional and have fewer side effects.

                        Restore uses two ancient super foods: olive oil, along with olive leaf, and black seed oil. Both abound with health benefits and have been used successfully as natural remedies for thousands of years. To those, additional antioxidants, adaptogens, and essential oils are added that have specific functionality and documented health benefits.
                        
                        These two super foods, along with the additional ingredients, are amplified by a delivery system called XDS (eXponential Delivery System). This proprietary nutrient delivery system was developed by Dr.Elliott, to target every cell in the body to deliver nutrition deep into cells and into mitochondria.
                        
                        Why is this important? Because, to have the very best results, great natural ingredients alone are not good enough. The natural bioactive ingredients, typically, contained in nutritional supplements can have poor deliverability and don’teasily get to where they need to go, to do the most good.
                        
                        XDS formulations rectify this problem in a powerful way. It, typically, uses only a fraction of the normal daily dose, for a given bioactive ingredient, compared to how much of the same ingredient is commonly used in other nutritional supplement formulations. Yet XDS is so effective, that much greater benefits can result. Nutrients tend to work faster and with much greater results for more people.</p>

                      <p>The recommended dose of Restore is 4 mL or 4/5 teaspoon. This is a little less than a full teaspoon per day. A loading dose of double or more for the first week is ok. How you take Restore is a matter of personal preference. It can be taken morning or evening in a single dose or split up, with or without food. Some people have reported having very vivid dreams, in some cases, for the first time since they were very young. If you don’t want to dream, consider taking restore earlier in the day or first thing in the morning.</p><br>
